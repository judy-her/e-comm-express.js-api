This application was made for businesses to keep track of their company products. These products are given categories and several tags. This app is made with an API that utilizes Express.js, with Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The API has three routes : categories,products, and tags. Each route is able to get all Categories, Products, and Tags. Each route is then able to be fetched by using a single id. New Categories, Products, and Tags can be created, updated, and/or deleted.
